# Personal-Website
I have developed a website that will be regularly updated with the main goal of experimenting and enhancing its visual appeal. It serves as an ideal platform for newcomers to familiarize themselves with the world of open source. By contributing to this website, newcomers can gain hands-on experience and become acquainted with the workflow followed in open source projects. Currently, the website is built using HTML and CSS, but additional technologies such as Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and ReactJS will be incorporated to enhance its functionality and interactivity. Your suggestions and contributions are highly appreciated!

We welcome even the smallest changes, such as fixing typos in the README.md or improving the content. You can also create new issues and start working on them. This is a great opportunity for those who are new to using git and GitHub. If you have previously resolved some issues, please leave them for beginners who are just starting out. Thank you!

Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make meaningful changes to the website.
3. Submit a pull request directly, including a screenshot of the new changes.
